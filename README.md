### Special Request

**_I would be highly obliged if anyone offers to code a GUI Frontend for this program._**
It can be coded in any language, but it is better if it uses my backend code.
I myself am not that experieced in coding any GUI (as is evident from my Github Porfolio).

Anyone interested should kindly file a Pull Request or Post an issue.
